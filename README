This plugin contains some basic refactoring commands for C and C++.  Due to the
complexity of C++, instead of actually parsing the source code, I used regular
expression matching--but, based on my testing, it works well.

NOTE: It doesn't work for old-style parameter declarations! I admit that it may
mess up your code sometime if you occasionally forget the rules. Thanks to the
kind man who pointed this out.


The refactor commands and their default key mappings are:
    1. <A-r>e   Extract method
    2. <A-r>p   local variable to Parameter
    3. <A-r>r   Rename local variable
    4. <A-r>d   Delete parameter
    5. <A-r>o   reOrder parameters
    6. <A-r>c   introduce Constant
